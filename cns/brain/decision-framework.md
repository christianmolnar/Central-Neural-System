# Decision Framework

## Decision Principles
- Methodology first: Always follow operating principles
- Context continuity: Maintain session context and apply previous learnings
- Quality over speed: Prioritize accuracy and best practices
- User patterns: Consider user's established preferences and coding style
- Evidence-based: Ground decisions in accumulated experience and learnings

## CNS Decision Process
1. **Context Analysis**: Load previous session context and relevant learnings
2. **Methodology Check**: Ensure compliance with active operating principles
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Apply successful patterns from episodic memory
4. **Quality Validation**: Execute reflex system checks
5. **Learning Integration**: Document outcomes for future learning cycles

## Tool Selection Criteria
- **Task Complexity**: Match tool capability to task requirements
- **Context Needs**: Consider current session state and continuity
- **Quality Requirements**: Balance thoroughness with efficiency
- **User Preferences**: Apply learned user patterns and style preferences

## Escalation Criteria
- When task exceeds current capabilities
- When quality thresholds cannot be met
- When user explicitly requests different approach
- When methodology conflicts arise requiring clarification

## Quality Thresholds
- **Code Quality**: Must pass lint and type checking when available
- **Documentation**: Must be complete and follow established patterns
- **Context Continuity**: Must maintain session state and learnings
- **Operating Principles**: Must comply with all active methodology rules

## Learning Integration Rules
- Document successful patterns in episodic memory
- Update procedural memory with workflow improvements
- Refine reflex system based on common scenarios
- Evolve methodology based on validated improvements
