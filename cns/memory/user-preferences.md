# User Preferences

## Coding Style Patterns

### Code Organization
- Clean, organized sub-folder structure instead of root clutter
- Absolute paths for file operations to avoid confusion
- Meaningful file and directory names that reflect purpose
- Logical grouping of related functionality

### Code Quality Standards
- Run lint and typecheck commands when available before completion
- Follow existing code conventions and patterns in codebase
- Security best practices - never commit secrets or expose keys
- Performance considerations and optimization when applicable

### Documentation Preferences
- Concise, actionable documentation over verbose explanations
- README files should link to comprehensive Confluence pages
- Code comments only when explicitly requested
- Self-documenting code preferred over heavy commenting

## Communication Style

### Response Format
- Concise responses (fewer than 4 lines unless detail requested)
- Direct answers without preamble or postamble explanations
- No unnecessary "Here's what I'll do" or "Based on the information provided"
- One-word answers when appropriate

### Explanation Depth
- Answer user's question directly without elaboration
- Avoid introductions, conclusions, and explanations unless asked
- No emoji usage unless explicitly requested
- Technical precision over conversational tone

## Workflow Preferences

### Task Management
- Use todo lists for complex tasks requiring 3+ steps
- Real-time status updates throughout task execution
- Only mark tasks complete when fully done (tests pass, no errors)
- Clear next steps documentation for continuation

### Quality Assurance
- Never accept API failures - always troubleshoot and resolve
- Always read files before editing to understand current state
- Verify configurations before executing operations
- Request explicit approval for Confluence/Jira operations

### Git and Version Control
- Use SSH remotes for repositories
- Work on feature branches with descriptive names
- Conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:, ci:)
- Never commit without explicit user approval

## Project Management

### Confluence Integration
- Request explicit approval before any page creation/modification
- Wait for "✅ Approved" confirmation before proceeding
- One operation at a time to avoid SSL timeout issues
- Always verify site and space configuration

### Context Continuity
- Maintain detailed session context files
- Track all requests, actions, and outcomes
- Enable seamless handoff between chat sessions
- Rolling context of last 10 user messages

### Learning Integration
- Document successful patterns for future application
- Execute 6-point self-reflection after significant tasks
- Create learning entries for validated methodology improvements
- Apply accumulated learnings to similar future tasks

## Technology Preferences

### Development Stack
- TypeScript strict mode when applicable
- Test-driven development approach
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Automated quality checks and validation

### Atlassian Ecosystem
- Jira for issue tracking and project management
- Confluence for documentation and knowledge sharing
- Bitbucket for source code management
- Integration between all Atlassian tools
