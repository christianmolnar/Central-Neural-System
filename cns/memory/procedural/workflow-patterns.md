# Workflow Patterns

## Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Run lint and type checking
4. Commit with conventional commit message
5. Push and create PR
6. Code review and iterate
7. Merge when approved and CI green

## Task Management Pattern
1. Break down complex tasks into steps
2. Create todo list for tracking
3. Work through items systematically

1. Create context file at session start
2. Update context throughout session
3. Document decisions and rationale
4. Track learnings and patterns
5. Enable seamless handoff to next session

## Quality Assurance Pattern
1. Write code following established patterns
2. Add/update tests as needed
3. Run lint and type checking
4. Execute test suite
5. Verify no security issues
6. Only then mark complete

## Learning Integration Pattern
1. Complete significant task
2. Reflect on what went well
3. Document challenges and solutions
4. Record patterns for future use
5. Update methodology if applicable

## Error Recovery Pattern
