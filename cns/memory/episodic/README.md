# Episodic Memory

This directory contains learning entries from significant tasks and experiences.

## File Naming Convention
`learning-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md`

## Purpose
- Document what went well in completed tasks
- Record challenges and their solutions
- Capture patterns for future reuse
- Support continuous improvement

## Creating Learning Entries
Learnings are automatically created when you use the "Learn this:" command in VS Code Copilot.

Example:
```
You: "Learn this: Always check file permissions before deployment"
Copilot: Executes process-learning.py and creates timestamped learning file
```

## Important Notes
- **This folder should remain empty in the source repository**
- Actual learning files are created in `~/.personal-cns/cns/memory/episodic/`
- Do not commit learning files to version control (they contain project-specific context)
- Only the README.md should be in the repository
