# Personal Central Neural System for VS Code Copilot

## Overview
A sophisticated AI assistant enhancement framework that transforms VS Code Copilot into a learning, context-aware development companion with advanced memory, reflexes, and continuous improvement capabilities.

## Purpose
Enhance VS Code Copilot from a coding assistant into a sophisticated AI development companion with:
- **Enhanced Memory**: Learn and apply your patterns, preferences, and coding style
- **Intelligent Reflexes**: Automatic quality assurance and personalized workflows
- **Learning Cycles**: Continuous improvement through experience accumulation
- **CNS Architecture**: Foundation for building sophisticated AI assistance

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone <your-repo-url> ~/personal-cns-system

# Copy CNS to your home directory
mkdir -p ~/.personal-cns
cp -r cns ~/.personal-cns/
cp -r document-library ~/.personal-cns/
```

### VS Code Setup
1. Copy `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to your VS Code workspace `.github/` folder
2. Restart VS Code or reload window
3. Open Copilot Chat - CNS should initialize automatically

## Key Features

### Enhanced Memory System
- **Episodic Memory**: Experience and event tracking
- **Semantic Memory**: Knowledge and concept storage  
- **Procedural Memory**: Skill and workflow optimization
- **Context Continuity**: Seamless handoff across sessions

### Intelligent Reflexes
- **Automatic Responses**: Trigger-based quality actions
- **Error Handling**: Sophisticated recovery procedures
- **Quality Checks**: Multi-level validation systems
- **Learning Integration**: Experience-based optimization

### Central Neural System (CNS)
- **Brain**: Core identity, capabilities, and decision-making
- **Memory**: Multi-faceted learning and experience storage
- **Reflexes**: Automatic responses and quality assurance
- **Integration**: Prompt engineering and coordination

### Learning Cycles
- **6-Point Self-Reflection**: Systematic post-task evaluation
- **Pattern Recognition**: Successful behavior reinforcement
- **Continuous Improvement**: Methodology evolution based on experience
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Cross-session learning

## How It Works

### Session Initialization
1. Open VS Code with Copilot enabled
2. Start a new Copilot chat session
3. CNS automatically loads Prime Principles, recent learnings, and user patterns
4. Context from previous sessions available for restoration

### During Development
- Copilot applies learned preferences automatically
- Quality checks run reflexively (lint, type checking)
- Successful patterns reinforced through episodic memory
- Context continuously updated for handoff

### Learning Integration
- Complete significant tasks → Automatic learning capture
- Patterns recognized → Stored in semantic memory
- Methodology improvements → Integrated into Prime Principles
- User preferences → Updated in user patterns

## Customization

### Adapt Prime Principles
Edit `~/.personal-cns/cns/brain/prime-principles.md` with your own development principles.

### Configure User Preferences
Update `~/.personal-cns/cns/memory/user-preferences.md` and `~/.personal-cns/cns/brain/user-patterns.md`.

### Add Custom Reflexes
Extend `~/.personal-cns/cns/reflexes/trigger-responses.md` with your automated workflows.
