## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Prove Native Compatibility
1. **Test Native Integration** - Verify `~/.codelassian/` structure modifications control behavior
2. **Memory Enhancement** - Extend native memories with user pattern learning
3. **Basic Reflexes** - Simple automatic responses and quality checks

### Phase 2: Enhanced Codelassian Dev Companion
1. **User Pattern Learning** - Learn coding style, preferences, and mannerisms
2. **Intelligent Reflexes** - Personalized quality assurance and workflows
3. **Learning Cycles** - Continuous improvement through experience

### Phase 3: Atlassian PgM Assistant (Same Architecture)
1. **Single Rovo Agent** - Apply identical CNS architecture to enterprise agent
2. **PgM Specialization** - CPO Canonical Activities automation
3. **Enterprise Deployment** - Rovo marketplace distribution

## Key Features
